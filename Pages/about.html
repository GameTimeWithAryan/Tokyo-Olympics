        <p class="others-content">
          Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in
          Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.Originally scheduled to
          take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to
          2021 in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first
          such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had
          been cancelled but not rescheduled).However, the event retained the
          Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes.It was largely
          held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to
          the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in
          response to the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p class="others-content">
          The 2020 Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan,
          following the Tokyo 1964 (Summer), Sapporo 1972 (Winter) and Nagano
          1998 (Winter) games. Tokyo was the first city in Asia to hold the
          Summer Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three
          consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018
          Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022
          Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. New events were introduced in
          existing sports for 2020, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and
          mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as
          the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same
          event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing
          committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games.
          The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball
          and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the
          last four of which made their Olympic debuts.
        </p>
        <p class="others-content">
          The United States topped the medal count by both total golds (39) and
          total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38
          and 88). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the
          most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an
          Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a
          total of 22 gold and 65 medals, becoming the first nation at the
          Summer Olympics to increase or equal their total medals won in the two
          Games subsequent to hosting them. The Russian delegation competing as
          the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall
          medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won
          their first-ever Olympic gold medals. Burkina Faso, San Marino and
          Turkmenistan won their first-ever Olympic medals.
