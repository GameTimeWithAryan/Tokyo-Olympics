        India finished 48th on the medal tally in Tokyo, its highest ranking
        in over four decades (if one were to go by the total number of medals,
        India would have actually finished 33rd. However, ranking is done
        primarily based on gold medals won). The previous best in this period
        was the 51st rank finish at Beijing in 2008, when India won three
        medals, including Abhinav Bindra's gold.
